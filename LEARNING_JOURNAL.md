### COMPONENT PACKAGE

**PROBLEM:**
I created a scene with 2 planes, a player object and a turret on the second plane. I wanted it so that when the player entered the second area, the turret would activate and start firing the bullets. I also wanted it so that when the player entered it, a timer would start and if the timer ran out, the turret would cool down for a set time and the cool down time would display.

To start, I created a PlayerMovement script, a TurretMovement script and a BulletController script. The TurretMovement script just updates the turret object to look at the player and the BulletController script instantiates the bullet prefab with a force repeatedly after a set time.

I wanted these scripts to be activated when the player collides with the second plane area collider.

I created a script called TurretOn which would find out when the player collides with the area, and pass a boolean value of true to both of the other scripts.


**SOLUTION:**
When trying to pass the boolean value from this TurretOn script to the other two scripts, I had set the boolean value to private, which meant the scripts could not access this value. I changed this to a public variable and used â€œ { get; private set} to make the variable accessible via scripts but not accessible in the Unity editor.

**PROBLEM:**
I wanted the bullets fired to destroy after a set amount of time. I tried editing the update function in the BulletController script and thought creating a bulletTime float, decrementing it by time and setting that when this float is equal to 0, the clone gameobject of the instantiated bullet prefab would destroy by using clone.IsDestroyed. However, this did not work.

**SOLUTION:**
I asked a peer for some help. They showed me how creating a script for this destroy function would be the best way. I created a script called BulletDestroy and created an if statement to say that if bulletTime is less than or equal to 0, the gameobject that the script is on will destroy.
